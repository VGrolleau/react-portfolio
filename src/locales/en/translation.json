To do this, we need to integrate D3 or Recharts (my choice for this project) graphs of the user's sporting activity. As for the data, we need to make calls to the back-end in NodeJS. To manage these calls, we need to use either Fetch (my choice) or Axios, and make them outside the React components via a separate service. The site also needs a data modeling class to ensure that data is properly formatted. Last but not least, the code must be well documented, via capsules and PropTypes in the latter, but also via the Readme.",
